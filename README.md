# Project description
This project implements two dynamic spatiotemporal interpolation (DST) methods, i.e., coarse-grained DST (CGDST) and fine-grained DST (FGDST) using both temporal and spatial interpolation results. Different from other hybrid spatiotemporal interpolation methods, they make differences in the contribution of temporal and spatial interpolation results and assign them with different weights. Both CGDST and FGDST treat each missing value differently and fill it by considering the reliability of both temporal and spatial interpolation results in terms of the lengths of its column gap and row gap. CGDST treats each missing value in a continuous missing area equally and all missing values have same lengths of column and row gaps and FGDST goes beyond CGDST and treats each missing value differently based on its temporal distance to the nearest real observed values in both forward and backward directions.

In order to demonstrate the superiority of two dynamic interpolation methods proposed by this work, this project also implements eight interpolation methods, i.e., LT [1], OK [2], RST [3], EST [3], EFIM [4], HST [5], ST-ISE [6] and BiLSTM [7].

# The implementation details

this project, the interpolate() function of pandas DataFrame was employed to implement LT. To implement linear interpolation, the parameter method was set to 'linear' and the parameter limit_direction was set to 'both' to fill missing values in both forward and backward direction. This is helpful when the first value or the last value of time series data is missing. OK was implemented by using PyKrige, which is a toolkit for Python and it supports 2D and 3D ordinary and universal kriging. It is worth noticing that OK requires at least three observed real data values to predict missing values and the average values of the observed real values were used if the number of the observed real values is less than three. RST was implemented by filling missing values with LT first and then revised the interpolation results based on OK. More precisely, for each value filled by LT, it is revised by using existing observed real values and the LT interpolation results of other missing values based on OK. EST was implemented by using OrdinaryKriging3D() method of PyKrige. For each missing value, EST fills it by using latitudes and longitudes of all observed values within two hours. Moreover, EST employs the time distance between the missing values and the other observed values within two hours. The time distance is calculated by dividing the time difference by the time step, which is one in the experiments. To increase the contribution of temporal relationship, the value of time difference is magnified 10 times. EFIM considered the effect of all nearby monitoring stations within two hours for interpolation. HST was implemented based on linear regression of the interpolation results of LT and OK. The linear regression of HST is implemented by sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression. 

For the SES model, ST-ISE selected the optimal historical time window first and then assigned different weights to the samples in the window to calculated the temporal interpolation results. For the spatial interpolation, ST-ISE also considered the effect of all nearby monitoring stations in the datasets. BiLSTM considered three nearest monitoring stations and the observed values four hours before and after the interpolation time. This work selected all stations which did not have missing values four hours before and after the interpolation time first and selected three nearest stations. If there were less three stations, the average values of the existing observed values were used as the interpolation results. ST-ISE and BiLSTM were implemented by PyTorch, which a widely used deep learning library developed by Facebook.

The temporal and spatial interpolation results used by two DST models were estimated by LT and OK, respectively. Moreover, the DST models are also implemented by PyTorch to perform the regression analysis with a purpose of finding an optimal dynamic weight coefficient to balance the contribution of the spatial and temporal interpolation results. More precisely, the regression model was created using torch.nn.Linear and the sigmoid function, which is PyTorch sub-module for neural network. In addition, MSE (Mean Squared Error) was used as loss function and Adam was employed as optimizer to find regression coefficients when the loss function is minimum. To obtain optimal DST models, different small learning rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.002 and different the number of epochs ranging from 500 to 3000 were used to train the models on different datasets.
